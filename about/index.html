      You ask who runs this page yet you cannot even face the truth and look into yourself, tell me Luna, is there any resembelance of sanity left in that head of yours? Or have you finally lost it, I know how difficult it has become for you. <br>Why do you even question, you know the answer, you know the truth. You just need to look. There is always another.
